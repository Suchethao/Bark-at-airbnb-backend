       "neighborhood_overview":"South Harlem is one of the most charming neighborhoods in Manhattan, and particularly the area I'm in on Frederick Douglass Blvd. There are a ton of locally owned and run restaurants, bars, and coffee shops all within 5-10 blocks of my apartment. But my favorite part is the parks: Morningside Park is a mere 2 blocks west, and Central Park is 7 blocks south.",
       "notes":"As I mentioned in the listing, I have two cats and a dog. The two cats are named Jeremiah (grey one in the bedroom photo) and Naomi (fluffy one in the kitchen photo.) They are both not at all aggressive and Jeremiah acts more like a puppy than a cat, so I hope you like snuggles! Moses, my dog, travels with me or stays with a friend when I'm gone, but the cats get mad if I try to bring them anywhere besides the apartment, so they will be there while you stay. As shared in the listing description, my apartment is listed at about 15% below the market rate for comparable apartments as a result, but please let me know when you book if you would rather a pet-sitter comes 1-2x/day to feed them and clean the litterbox during your stay instead.",
       "transit":"The B/C train is conveniently located just a block away, which can get you downtown or further uptown, and there are plenty of buses that can take you crosstown if you need. There are also plenty of cabs in the area and usually plenty of Ubers (or Uber alternatives) around as well.",
       "access":"For longer stays, I will clear a drawer for you to use in the dresser, but otherwise please stay out of the bedroom closet, dresser, and vanity. Of course you are welcome to use the vanity to get ready - the lighting is amazing for make-up! I work in beauty so it's one of my favorite spaces in the apartment :)",
       "interaction":"I may be traveling internationally during your stay, but I have lots of close friends (and fellow AirBnBers) in the neighborhood who can help with any immediate needs. I also can always be reached on my cell phone regardless of where I am, and I will share that number with you upon confirming your reservation.",
       "house_rules":"NOTE: I have a dog and two cats. The dog travels with me but sadly the cats cannot. I am fastidiously clean and have a Roomba that vacuums 1-2x a day, every day, but pets are pets so there may be some fur and dander in the apartment. If you don't like or are allergic to animals, this may not be the best fit for you.  They are both very sweet and easy! If you prefer to have someone come in and take care of them during your stay, I can arrange that as well. I will happily leave you some basics in the fridge and of course all necessities are included (eg: towels, sheets, pillows,) but I do ask that you not partake from the bar. You are more than welcome welcome to bring your own alcohol into the house but please don't drink mine ;)",

       "neighborhood_overview":"Yorkville is the Upper East Side neighborhood you will b staying in. It's awesome yes, but more for grown-ups. If you want a clubbing weekend, head farther south to Midtown or Specifically Hells Kitchen and the Meatpacking Districts. The Yorkville neighborhood is older but true NY and sparse on tourists. It's also home to Gracie Mansion, several celebrities, and many high net worth individuals. Every Avenue offers you something new - from the East River Park to Central Park, there are many amazing restaurants, shops and museums in between. And as many dogs as people! The closer you get to the park, the more money you need in your pocket. The 4/5/6 subway is a 3 block walk and the famous Guggenheim museum is at the end of E 89th street, right at the entrance to Central Park. Wake up and fit a walk or run in around the reservoir (or run the entire 7 mile loop of a Central Park for those ambitious ones!). Tons of shopping is available in and around 86th street or you can walk down famous",

Unless you’re rich but if that's the case then you most likely are not on Air B&B for any real purpose.

       "neighborhood_overview":"The highly desired neighborhood is quite lively after the sun goes down. The East Village has been heavily built up over the last 5-10 years and located on the East side of Manhattan from 14th St down to Houston (same as street zero) which borders the LES (Lower East Side). Tompkins Square Park is a block away, which has basketball courts, dog run and plenty of benches and grassy areas to relax. You can walk to Indian, Russian, Italian, Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Vegetarian and American restaurants within a 5 block radius. If you're too tired and beat up from touring NYC and don't feel like going anywhere, you can simply order in and have anything delivered to the room (usually until 11 pm or midnight). And these little privately owned restaurants are MUCH better than midtown/tourist-trap food chain places. There are at least three 24/hr places to eat within 2 blocks.  There are about 50 restaurant/bars/cafe's within a 3 block radius and probably 500 within a 10 block radius.",

This is for use of a furnished apartment (bungalow) rental and loud noise will not be tolerated as there are full time tenants/neighbors that work normal business hours and my neighbors peace cannot and will not be disrupted. If you're a group of drinkers/clubbers who will be out late and loud at night, please do NOT inquire.",
       "transit":"Subway (L, F, V) are about a 10 minute walk, or you can catch a bus on the closest corner and a 10 minute ride to Union Square where you can take any subway line to get anywhere in NYC.. Taxis everywhere, usually takes a minute or two standing in front of building. I highly recommend walking. After living here my entire life, I've found it pretty much takes 20-40 minutes to get anywhere in Manhattan, FROM anywhere in Manhattan. Walking is free, by far the safest way to travel and you get to see cool stuff along the way and don't have to wait for anything.",

Please clean up after yourself. The house cleaner will come sanitize the apartment, but its not her job to do your dishes.

       "neighborhood_overview":"Our block, between First and Second Avenues is completely residential. In most of Manhattan, and especially in this neighborhood, the nearer one stays to an avenue or on an avenue (rather than on a street), and the nearer one stays to transportation centers (here Lexington and 116th and 125th Streets) the greater the noise level and the denser the traffic and crowds. I urge you to read the reviews from prior guests to gain their appreciation of the neighborhood. The neighborhood is quite safe at all hours. I do suggest that guests might feel more comfortable if they use a taxi when returning after about 11:00 pm. People are very friendly and will go out of their way to be helpful.",
       "notes":"PRICING--IMPORTANT: The price you will be quoted by AirBnb already includes a discount for stays of 7 nights or longer. Also, I have been asked in the last several inquiries (in early June 2016) to provide the total cost for a stay. I AM UNABLE TO DO THAT, BECAUSE: (1) if you are inquiring from within the United States, your cost will be shown in US. However, that cost includes a commission that you pay to AirBnb. I do not know what the commission rate is and I have no control over the amount of that commission. (2) If you inquire from outside the US, I believe your total cost is shown in your country's currency. I have no idea what exchange rate AirBnb applies and no control over that exchange rate. Also, as said above, I have no control over the rate or amount of commission AirBnb charges you, as a guest. On my end of the transaction, I see only the gross amount in US that I will receive based on my daily or weekly rates; AirBnb also deducts a commission from that payment to me bef",

Buses are available within a block and half. Please (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) NYC or Manhattan transportation so you have an idea of the subway network. The nearest line is Lexington Ave (Green line on the maps) which runs the entire length of Manhattan and is one of the most convenient methods of transport you will find in Manhattan.

       "access":"We are a semi-retired professional couple who delight in meeting new people. We converted this four story brownstone in 1985-87 and have been living here since.  We do have an arrival (3:00 pm and later) and departure (11:00 am) schedule which we appreciate your meeting if possible. However, we are quite flexible. If no guests arrive the next day, you are welcome to stay later; if no guests have departed the previous day, you are welcome to arrive earlier. If your arrival will be late in the day (i.e. evening or night) please let me know so we can best coordinate a smooth introduction.   Please note that we insist on no smoking or drugs or partying in and about the house and the apartment and no guests of guests! We are a quiet couple who prefer classical music and gentle R&R to R&B and certainly to rap--which will be freely available as you wander nearby streets. Please, no pets.",
       "interaction":"The degree of interaction is entirely up to you.  We are happy to provide a light breakfast or even simple meals to enjoy in the apartment for the first day or two until you are settled in and acclimated to our local time if you are travelling from outside the US.  We have a small Maltese dog, \"Lady Windermere.\" She appears in one of the photos, though her favorite spot is on my shoulder. As you may know, the breed is hypoallergenic and does not shed. She is sweet and lively and may bark until she comes to know you. By the time you leave, you may want to take her with you, but we will not allow that. On the other hand, you need not see her or us for your entire stay if that is your wish. I do communicate with you before your arrival regarding transportation to and from the house. And, I do check in on you during your stay to make sure everything is to your satisfaction. I am always available to answer questions.  Please read the reviews to gain an impression of me and my hosting style.",

But further, I am a naval architect and marine engineer and a maritime lawyer, having practiced law since 1977. I continue to practice law and engineering consulting on a less hurried schedule. I am also a published (not widely by any means) poet. My spouse, Paula, is a Ph.D., NY State licensed psychologist. We are both very well read and the house has a library approaching 2000 volumes on all kinds of subjects ranging from NYC, to anthropology, philosophy, religion, psychology, literature and poetry, art, and ships.  \r\n*****\r\nYou will see below a review by Hans Christian Knudsen from Arhus, Denmark written in Danish. Here is a translation (which it is not possible for me to post under the Reviews section at this point):\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Willa had bought bread, cheese and red wine. What a welcome! We then discovered that she also had put a personal letter to us about the area, about the apartment and tips for good restaurants, shops and how to get the best with subway in NYC. Of course was also just a bouquet of fresh flowers that matched the apartment's colors. Willa is the perfect host and the apartment was a perfect setting for our 10 day vacation in NYC. And Harlem is a colorful area to stay in.\"",

Throw into the mix plenty of Columbia Med School students in scrubs and off-duty cops and that will round out the scene at many a happy hour in the Heights. Stay at the heart of Upper Manhattan area Washington Heights , walking distance to the George Washington bridge, delicious restaurants, happening bars, and more! Kitchen is accessible and there are two large supermarkets just one and two blocks away. Apartment is one block away from subway line A which will connect you to the entire city! Apartment is 15-20 min ride from Times Square and other attractions away. This is a two bedroom apartment. Rooms for guests are air conditioned with full size bed. Complimentary WiFi, iron, hair dryer .  This is a charming building built in 1900. The apartment is on the first floor. If you want to visit NYC and have the New York experience, this is the place to be!",

Only 15-20 minutes away from cloud-punching high-rises, megawatt billboards, honking taxis - Midtown is movie set New York. Stay here and you'll be a few train stops away of Times Square, the Empire State Building and the Rockefeller Center, plus the bright lights of Broadway and shopping icons Bloomingdale's and Saks. The area's concentration of businesses means that whether you're craving a humble hot dog to a Michelin-starred feast, you'll find it here, and for ethnic eats don't miss to Korea town and Murray (aka Curry) Hill. Further south, Chelsea is contemporary art's HQ and home to the High Line, a sublime public park on an elevated railroad with the views to match. You can also enjoy free parking on our street or affordable nearby parking garages. You can easily take the A train at our apartment to: Brooklyn Heights Central Park C",

Look for the Taxi stand right outside the airport, where the yellow cabs are. Yellow cab takes cash or credit card.  The EASIEST way from airport is to use UBER! Download the Uber app on your smartphone & set up your account. When you land at airport and after you get your baggage, use Uber & put in my address for destination. They will pick you up in 1 min!

       "neighborhood_overview":"Comfortably fitting two on a quiet tree lined street, this home is perfect for those that want to experience Manhattan without being crowded into a tiny crammed hotel room. The apartment is located in one of the most luxurious neighborhoods in the city and is a great place to feel at home while being away from home.  I love everything about my neighborhood. Mostly residential, the street is quiet at night and busy during the day. There are many people out walking the dogs or taking children to the park, and I always feel quite safe.  Within close proximity are many restaurants and bars, I always find a new one to try when walking around, so I am never bored! I am close to Central Park when I want to escape the 'hustle and bustle' of the city. There is plenty of shopping in the area with new stores coming in all of the time. It is easy to get almost anywhere in the city via bus transportation, subway, or simply walking.  There are multiple hospitals in the area and many doctors offices.",
       "notes":"SAFETY!: I live in a building with double door entry for extra security. I cannot even buzz a guest in without the guest buzzing my apartment number first, for both doors. I feel very safe with that entry system, as uninvited guests will find it very difficult to enter. There is also a channel on my television that will allow me to view the street and lobby area live. Parking:  Street parking is available (though limited). Circling the nearby blocks for a few minutes can increase your likelihood of finding a decent parking spot. If you are parking on the street, please make sure to double and triple check the signage. A vehicle parked incorrectly will no doubt receive a parking ticket within even a few minutes. My area has both metered and non-metered parking. There are also street cleaning hours, where no parking is allowed during certain periods on certain days. As I live near a post office, there are also Government Vehicles Only spots. There are parking garages available in my area",
       "transit":"Public Transportation:  Public Transportation is extremely convenient. The 6 train is conveniently located approximately a five minute walk away. The 6 train connects to E 59th Street, Grand Central Station, Union Square, The East Village, and many other convenient locations. The 6 train also connects to every other train line. Local busses are also available within one block. Taxis pass very often and can be hailed by raising your arm to signal the driver. I suggest walking to either corner for taxis as they are more frequent on the busier streets. Uber is available in the city, however Lyft can be SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper. There is also Gett, which offers 10 flat rates for anywhere in Manhattan for up to 4 passengers, and under 30 minute trips (which most will be from my area). I usually check each of the apps for each trip I take to price-check which is cheapest and fastest.  Parking:  Street parking is available (though limited).

We only rent the apartment when we are away so you'll have it all to yourself!

When you arrive, we'll coordinate you picking up the key either from one of us or from an assistant/colleague. All we ask is for a two hour window of time within which you will definitely arrive so that we can coordinate the key. When you leave, you can leave the key inside the apartment and leave it unlocked.",
       "house_rules":"Please do not smoke in the apartment or the back garden. We're on the first floor so it's only about ten steps to the street in case you do need a smoke break :) While it's certainly not a quiet zone, we do ask that you respect our neighbors and modulate noise after 10PM. That doesn't mean you can't talk or play music, just be cautious of the levels. Also the garden area is off-limits after 10PM as we share it directly with our next door neighbor, so we ask that you please respect that. Please shoot us a message to inquire about pets. While we have a dog (who will not be here at the time of rental) we just have to be cautious about which pets we allow at the apartment for obvious reasons - that said it's certainly a possibility!",

       "neighborhood_overview":"We live on the boarder of the Sugar Hill neighborhood home to a great many Jazz legends from the Golden age of jazz. Just around the corner on Broadway is a fantastic Harlem classic called the Harlem Public for amazing draft beers and modern soul-fare, a little further down from that is the chipped cup the best coffee in Harlem (easy to miss as its in the basement), also if you walk west on 149th past broadway you'll hit riverside park where you can take a fantastic romantic walk or morning run along the water. We're on express trains that take you quickly to the lower parts of the island and to Central Park in no time at all. Super accessible and tons of great eating and delivery options of you just want to cozy up in Harlem, too.",
       "notes":"Do not be alarmed if you hear hissing or sounds like someone is banging on a pipe! This is just our old school new york heating system doing its thing! Also, note that we do not have control over the heat as the building is all on the same system it is ALWAYS warm enough, but if you get TOO warm you can just open the door to the balcony as much as you need (I know, seems crazy) or if the temperature outside is above freezing you can turn on the air conditioner - please keep the screen closed to we don't get bugs in the house and please please do not use the air conditioner if the temperature outside is below freezing, ice forms in the air conditioner and it will blow out the motor!",
       "transit":"closest subway stations are 145th street (closest entrance on St. Nicholas between 148 and 147 street) for the B/D and A/C or a DIFFERENT 145th St. station on Broadway and 145th for the 1 local train (from which you can transfer to the 2/3 express). Also, a great way to get around in the city is Uber (get the app on your phone) which is even cheaper if you select UberPool",
       "access":"You will have access to the whole apartment, the closets and drawers are full though so pleas don't move things around, if you really need a drawer or space in the closet please message us to work out us clearing some space ahead of your arrival.",

       "house_rules":"We simply ask that our guests be respectful of our house and our neighbors.  For our neighbors- No late night parties, inside-voices on the balcony late at night and in the stairwell of the building at all times (we all live pretty close together in the city!) and please do not throw any trash not even cigarette butts off of the balcony (we have an ash tray for that!). Please no stomping competitions or Tim, our downstairs neighbor, will kill us when we get back!  For our house - Generally just please treat our stuff with care as you would your own. You are welcome to use teas coffees, oil/spices, any perishable fruit or veg we may have left behind for you, and condiments, but please don't eat our other food or drink our booze! Also, if you break something, please let us know immediately so we can tell you how much cash to leave for replacement. On that note, please don't use the crystal glasses because, I promise you, you don't want to have to pay to replace those!",

So throw off the bowlines, sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.”\r\n\r\nOur list of places we've traveled covers the globe, including Ireland (where Matt's relatives are from), Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Yellowstone National Park, Whistler British Columbia, Hungary, Germany, Kenya, Galapagos Islands, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Mexico, all of western Europe, Morocco and so many more to come... \r\n\r\nIn between trips, Matt works as a creative director at an advertising agency, while Allie runs her own interior design firm (thus our place has a professional designer's personal touch!)",

I love to visit India because it's so rich with opportunities to learn more about yoga. But my current travels (book tour!) are keeping me U.S.-based. I think my favorite place to visit so far is Bali. Though I've not yet made it to New Zealand. Very keen to!",

I like neat and tidy places to stay but like to be out meeting new people, seeing things and experiencing life. The simple things in life make me happy like good conversations, unusual colors stories, music, flower blooming, dogs, hugs, green plants and trees and smiles. My natural habitat is the beach but I find myself mostly living in urban environments so I don't know what happened there. I try to pack light in life in general. I am very respectful of places and things and you'll probably find it in better condition than you left it because as an interior designer I cannot help myself but to neaten things up. I try my best to be a free person, open and good to others.",

This burgeoning new spectrum of the rental market piqued my interest, and shortly thereafter two units in my own  portfolio became available.  So I decided to give this a try as compared to traditional term leasing and see how things turn out.   If it turns out well then perhaps it will become a more permanent fixture.  I have developed a refined taste in property over the years and I know how to identify and create value.

Head East for one of the best parks in the city, Carl Schurz where you can enjoy views of the East River, Astoria, the RFK and Queensboro bridges, as well as walk past Gracie Mansion (Mayor's House) and a couple dog runs filled with the neighborhood pets.  Head West and enjoy the many restaurants on 1st, 2nd and 3rd Avenue, stroll through Central Park, and visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim, or the Neue Gallery (Woman in Gold).  Our favorite spots to eat include Beyoglu (Turkish), Om (Indian), Nick's (Pizza), Poke (BYOB Sushi), Up Thai, Cavatappo (Italian), and the Gilroy (cocktails).  There's also some great local coffee spots (Joe, Petite Shell, Jax).  Or hop on the express train or crosstown bus and explore all that this city has to offer.",

       "transit":"To get to the West Side, the M79 and the M86 cross-town buses are just a short walk away. If going North or South, you can either take the M15 (express or local) right on 1st Avenue or it's about a ten minute walk to the 4\\5\\6 train.",
       "access":"Guest will have full access to bedroom, living room, kitchen and will be given a full set of keys upon arrival. Plus there is a beautiful roof-top that's private and a working grill for guests to use whenever they like. At night time feel free to plug in the lights for a great outdoor atmosphere!",
       "interaction":"Need help with directions? Suggestions for spots to eat? Want to relax on your own? You let me know and I will accommodate you. I'm happy to help you with whatever you need! Someone will always be there to greet you with keys and show you where all of the amenities are.",
       "house_rules":"Please make yourself at home. I only ask that there is no red wine on the couch and you treat the apartment, the building, and the neighborhood respectfully. Everyone in this area is super helpful and friendly, so if you need anything just ask.",

In 2008, my husband and I left our small one bedroom in the Upper East Side, to buy this beautiful duplex in Harlem, New York. We are extremely happy with our choice, we love the apartment, we have wonderful neighbors and the neighborhood is so interesting and friendly.\r\nMy husband is Italian and I am half Italian, half French. I am working as a consultant for international organizations in the field of rural development and the environment. I have to travel a lot for my work, and I spend a few months overseas every year. Francesco, my husband, is director of programming of a cultural center in Staten Island, with the aim to promote Italian culture in the US. He is also traveling quite a lot.\r\nWhat else... we have 2 kids (they come with me when I travel), and a small dog (who is not aloud to go in the floor where the bedrooms are). He is also traveling with us.. \r\nOur interests? New York, New York and New York... Reading, theater, music, friends, outdoors and travelling. \r\nI am also renting my apartment in the Alps, in Piedmont, Italy. Unfortunately, now that I am living in New York, I have no opportunities to spend time there. It is a great place for both summer and winter holidays.",

You will be located right on a main boulevard -- Broadway -- and are steps from the subway. It is very family oriented which means busy during the day, quiet (as much as NYC can be) at night. It is safe and you will feel very comfortable your entire stay. \r\n\r\nThere is no doorman in my building but there are two sets of very heavy double doors tenants need to go through to get into the building. The roof is locked with an alarm system so you can feel secured from the moment you enter into the building. \r\n\r\nThere are many restaurants right in the area and drug stores right down stairs for essentials. \r\n\r\nI will do my best to accommodate special requests -- depending upon what it is, there may be an additional cost -- for example -- if you'd like me to do some grocery shopping for you prior to your arrival I am happy to do so but I will keep the bill for reimbursement. \r\n\r\nThe apt will be very very clean upon your arrival. You can pay for a full cleaning -- professional -- prior to your arrival if you'd like. I have a wonderful cleaning service. The cost is 35. \r\n\r\nPlease send me any questions you have and I will get back to you within 24 hrs. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for considering staying in my lovely home. I hope to hear from you soon! \r\n\r\nEnjoy New York City!!!!!",

It's also a little quieter being located on a street rather than one of the larger avenues. On the same block as Tompkins park which has an outdoor gym, basketball courts, ping pong tables, grass to lay on, play areas for kids & a dog park. If you're lucky you'll see the Hawks who are residents in the trees!!!   It's a five minute walk from the East River which has a park and a running track, outdoor gym and you can walk south to walk under the Williamsburg bridge, Manhattan Bridge and the oldest, which is the Brooklyn bridge.   Also half a block from a citibike station which is NYC's bikeshare program and in my opinion the fastest and best way to get around & see the city. You can ride along the East River path down to Battery Park which overlooks the Statue of Liberty.",

       "neighborhood_overview":"The East Village is by far the most vibrant neighborhood of New York City. Jam-packed with unique bars, restaurants, and shops for all budgets, you won't run out of things to do even if you never venture beyond walking distance. Our street itself is pretty quiet and residential though. We live kitty-corner to Tompkins Square Park if you need your fix of greenery.",
       "notes":"We have a small non-shedding dog named Joey (who will not be present for the duration of your stay). For weekend stays, if you arrive early on Friday, my boyfriend and Joey will likely be present to let you in and welcome you to the apartment before leaving in the afternoon.  We have a window a/c in the bedroom and a fan in the living room but the bedroom a/c is generally enough to cool the entire apartment if the door is open.  Our toilet flush makes a weird sound which can startle new users :) The water temperature can fluctuate rapidly so please be careful.  Do not touch the pipes or radiator because they are hot.  There is no elevator in the building, but our place is on the ground level so that shouldn't be an issue.",

       "house_rules":"No smoking and keep the noise down at night.  Please lock the windows when you leave. The door locks on its own.  You can use the space heater if the bedroom gets cold but please turn it off when you're not using it, especially when you're not home, to save electricity.  Feel free to use any kitchen supplies - dishes, toaster, pots, etc - but please don't use metal on non-stick cookware. The trash chute is in the hallway and the recycling is in the backyard area. No need to put your sheets away, the cleaning service will take care of it.  Most importantly, please put your keys back in the lockbox when you leave.",

Some of the places I've been are Morocco, Italy, Colombia, Cuba, Israel, Argentina, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic as well as many of the American States. When I'm not writing I can be found walking my adopted dog Justice to the Saint Nicholas dog park for some fun in the sun. I grew up in Denver Colorado but have lived in New York for 28 years and counting. I am familiar with much of NYC and I can't imagine living in any other place.  My home in Harlem suits me because it's in an energetic, vibrant, and diverse community. My neighborhood is a wonderful place to live and I'm always meeting new people thanks to Justice. On some nights I like to go to the local lounge and listen to Jazz, soul, and blues music. \r\n\r\nI love Film and am happy to share my film collection with you. I have hundreds of my favorite movies and you can watch any of them. A few of my favorites are True Romance, A Clockwork Orange, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Cool Hand Luke, Taxi Driver, and The Princess Bride. \r\n\r\nI ask that you treat my home with the same respect you would expect from me in your home. That means being respectful of my neighbors and community. Putting things back in their place for the next guest to enjoy, and caring for my property as you care for your own. In other words my home is your home. Welcome to Harlem NYC!",

The West Village is truly special - and something you'll have to experience at least once!",

       "host_about":"Hi I'm  Ephraim, \r\n\r\na former NYC public school teacher, currently  a writer and avid traveler. Some of the places I've been are Morocco, Italy, Colombia, Cuba, Israel, Argentina, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic as well as many of the American States. When I'm not writing I can be found walking my adopted dog Justice to the Saint Nicholas dog park for some fun in the sun. I grew up in Denver Colorado but have lived in New York for 28 years and counting. I am familiar with much of NYC and I can't imagine living in any other place.  My home in Harlem suits me because it's in an energetic, vibrant, and diverse community. My neighborhood is a wonderful place to live and I'm always meeting new people thanks to Justice. On some nights I like to go to the local lounge and listen to Jazz, soul, and blues music. \r\n\r\nI love Film and am happy to share my film collection with you. I have hundreds of my favorite movies and you can watch any of them. A few of my favorites are True Romance, A Clockwork Orange, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Cool Hand Luke, Taxi Driver, and The Princess Bride. \r\n\r\nI ask that you treat my home with the same respect you would expect from me in your home. That means being respectful of my neighbors and community. Putting things back in their place for the next guest to enjoy, and caring for my property as you care for your own. In other words my home is your home. Welcome to Harlem NYC!",

I purchased my 120 year old Harlem Brownstone 9 years ago and spent several years renovating it into its present beautiful condition.  I love this neighborhood and have many dear friends who live on the block.  I really hope that the guests who stay in the house can experience all of the wonderful things about Harlem and New York City while relaxing in their own private historic NYC Brownstone!  I personally love to take my dogs to Central Park, travel, read and spend time with family and friends enjoying NYC!!!",

       "neighborhood_overview":"One of the hottest locations in New York - the Lower East Side is the epicenter of some of the best restaurants, bars, Speakeasies, galleries, boutiques and music venues in the city !  It's an historical neighborhood. It's beautiful. Best brunchs of NYC are right there. The street is clean and cute. Lots of big fat friendly cats napping all around in the street.  There's a Gym center 2 blocks away  from the apartment, with really reasonable fees if you wanna try on the real NYC experience adding Pilates, Zumba, Yoga or Masala Banghra (Bollywood dance) classes... and be allowed to guilt-free-eat anything you want during the rest of the day ! (...I'll assure you that with our personal adresses, you'll find your everyday treats) Grocery stores and Laundry facilities are steps away. Chinatown's proximity will offer you the best of itself : tons of gastronomic discoveries, massages & mysterious medicinal herbs right around the block...!",
       "notes":"Please note :  - The keyboard piano is available for our guests - Guitars are not free to use, except for professional musicians, and only case by case.  - There are two desks in the living room. The computer is not included in the rental.",
       "transit":"Closest Subways:  F stop is East Broadway (0.1 mile from the apt.) B, D stop is Grand Street  J, M stop is Delancey Street  6 stop is Canal Street Bus : M9, M15 & M22 There's a Citibike station 2 mins away. You'll be very close from the waterfront, so you can allow yourself to walk by the East river at night and stare at the truly amazing view of both Manhattan & Brooklyn Bridge. Destinations like Soho, the Financial District, Little Italy, Nolita, East Village and South Street Seaport are 20 mins walk from the apartment.   10/15 mins walk from Williamsburg Bridge, Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn bridge.  You can cross the bridge by foot. The view there is amazing, and you'll be in DUMBO or Williamsburg (Bedford) in 45 mins. 45 mins Subway ride from Coney Island (Beach, hot-dogs & roller coasters !!)",

We'll give you a list of our best confidential adresses, and that is something, I can tell ! Subway and Manhattan Maps available for your convenience. We will also give you a confidential & homemade Guidebook with plenty of awesome addresses to visit (restaurants, brunch, bars, etc.) in the neighborhood...  We've traveled with Airbnb for a very long time. We thought it was about time for us jump in the experience from the other side.

       "neighborhood_overview":"This apartment is located on Columbia's campus, offering a great location to visiting students, family, and friends.  It is also near Harlem, with easy access to Morningside Park (with a dog run at 114th street) and only three blocks from Riverside Park (providing great views of the Hudson and amazing trails for commuting downtown).   Appletree grocery is at 120th (one block away), Morton's is at 116th and Broadway, and MET is at 125 and Amsterdam.  Hamilton Deli is 24 hours and at 116th and Amsterdam as well! This is a college neighborhood, with a farmer's market on Sundays, bars, cafes, and restaurants.  Super easy commute downtown (M4, M11, M60, 1/A/D/F/C/B Trains), offers all the benefits of location with a fraction of the price of downtown Manhattan hotels.",
       "notes":"The washer and dryer are in the basement, as is the trash.  It is small, but homey and you will have everything you need here.  I have a small dog, so if you are super allergic to dogs, this is not the apartment for you. I try to de-fur everything, but as those of you with pets know, it is impossible to get every hair!",
       "transit":"This apartment is located 4 blocks from 116th street stop on the 1 train and 7 blocks from the A/C/D/E trains at the 125th Harlem Stop.  One can be downtown in around 20 minutes.  Easy access to taxis, and it is a super safe neighborhood.   It is also close to the M11, M60, and M4 buses.",
       "access":"You will access to the whole apartment.",
       "interaction":"This will be your apartment, I will be off camping or staying with friends after I meet you to hand over keys.  There will however be numbers of people living in neighboring buildings that may be called for emergencies and can help you if you have any concerns.",
       "house_rules":"No Smoking in Building, unless electronic cigarettes (which are fine). This is a quiet building.  Guests are expected to be respectful of neighbors when coming in late.  I simply ask for people to be polite and respectful, but also they should feel free to make themselves at home and have fun!",

       "neighborhood_overview":"Northern Tribeca is calmer (not too many tourists) yet in close proximity to Soho (one block away), which has all the high-end shopping as well as the cheaper shopping strip along Broadway. There are great restaurants and lounges and cute cafes to explore.  The loft is also walking distance to the World Trade Center, 9/11 memorial, St. Paul's Chapel and all the historical charm of the Financial District which is immediately south of TriBeCa. And if you'd like to explore the more ethnic parts of New York, Little Italy and Chinatown are also nearby (less than 10 min walk).",
       "notes":"The Neighborhood I particularly love this area as TriBeCa is super famous for its food and lounge scene. There are countless top-rated and in some cases Michelin-starred restaurants in the area that are a gourmand's dream-come-true, as well as more hip and off-beat places like Macao Trading Company, Cafe Noir, and other interesting spots. There are also lots of cool art galleries as well as Hudson River Park to go walking or running. The TriBeCa Wholefoods is also close by. What I also like about this part of TriBeCa (northern part) is that it's much calmer yet in close proximity to Soho (one block away), which has all the high-end shopping as well as the cheaper shopping strip along Broadway. And if you're like me and a sucker for both, then hands down, this is the best location. There are also tons of cute restaurants in tree-lined streets to explore. The loft is also walking distance to the World Trade Center, 9/11 memorial, St. Paul's Chapel and all the historical charm of the Fina",
       "transit":"The other great thing is as Manhattan Island narrows on the way downtown, all the subways converge which makes getting around from Tribeca quick and easy. I'm two blocks from the A/C/E (which provides direct access to Penn Station, Port Authority, and Times Square) and one block from the 6, which goes directly to Grand Central Station and up the East Side to Museum Mile, and the N/Q/R. The 1 is about a 5 minute walk away. Canal Street, a major thoroughfare, provides quick transportation east or west and will take you to Chinatown if you go further East.",

In that case, you might see me in the kitchen.",

I have a fan in my room which I use at night for white noise--not necessary, but should you want it. Also, there is a Bose wireless stereo should you want to play low music.  Note:  This is a pre-war building from 1911 and is incredibly charming, but surely worn and loved in place. For example:  the pine plank floors are gorgeous and my favorite part, but aged! The heating has never been an issue for me, but you are unable to control the thermostat personally, which is typical for pre-war buildings in NYC.  Simple kitchen (half-fridge). None of this is an issue for me, I actually love the quirks and charm, but I want to be transparent so people are clear about what to expect!",

I work at a luxury travel company that allows me to explore the world--from tracking gorillas in East Africa to swimming alongside sharks in Thailand. My apartment is packed with keepsakes from around the world:  a berber door I lugged home from Morocco, marble candlesticks from Vietnam, and a silk Ikat weaving from Cambodia to name a few! \r\n\r\nI am a huge fan of homes with character, and this one fits the bill! I worked hard to create a space I really love in NYC and hope that the travelers who stay here enjoy it, too! My home is small, but it's got everything I need, and I love the vibe of the apartment. And you can't beat the location. I go to the coffee shop downstairs nearly every day, and walk to work along the Hudson River--just one block away. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\nKatie",

Since the newest renovation in April 2014, the apartment has been redesigned to offer an entertainment space for you or your travel companions who are staying in hotels farther from the action than you are.

Dining options range from the high-end Michelin-starred restaurants to funky ethnic Village and Lower East Side places--all within a 15-minute walk.",

You are free to use our perishables.  AS YOU LEAVE PLEASE STRIP SHEETS AND PILLOWCASES OFF BEDS AND PUT THESE AND USED TOWELS IN THE LAUNDRY.   Our caretaker remains for most bookings.  She has a private entrance and  bath -- and you would not see her -- and she can do errands and care for the apartment with you. Please note that checkout is  11:00 AM.  Check-in time is at 3:00 PM. This allows the apartment to be properly cleaned. If you have a later flight, or arrive very early, we can often make arrangements for you to leave your luggage even though the house is still being cleaned.  But do work that out with us and our caretaker.",

I Love this city and there's no place I rather be---except maybe for on top of the world. But, staying here, near the Crossroads, comes pretty close.\r\n\r\nI'm a homebody who balances butterflies, chases thrills and blesses my belly. Roaming endlessly is my therapy.. \r\n\r\nMy favorite pastimes in the City are:\r\n\r\n- stumbling into neighborhood bookstores and gift shops\r\n- hitting up an open mic or art gallery\r\n- park hopping in the summers after my favorite artists and musicians\r\n- touring the City with my brother, for whom it will never get old\r\n- visiting everything from Museum Mile to the Museum of Sex\r\n- randomly attending First Saturdays at the B'klyn Museum every purple moon\r\n- finding new ways to enjoy African and Caribbean foods nearly every weekend\r\n- stuffing dumplings in my bag, with two scoops of Ginger and Lychee ice cream in a cone in the other hand\r\n- dining on the delicious authentic Asian cuisine of China and Koreatown\r\n- and, staring at the Brooklyn Bridge",

Some of the places I've been are Morocco, Italy, Colombia, Cuba, Israel, Argentina, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic as well as many of the American States. When I'm not writing I can be found walking my adopted dog Justice to the Saint Nicholas dog park for some fun in the sun. I grew up in Denver Colorado but have lived in New York for 28 years and counting. I am familiar with much of NYC and I can't imagine living in any other place.  My home in Harlem suits me because it's in an energetic, vibrant, and diverse community. My neighborhood is a wonderful place to live and I'm always meeting new people thanks to Justice. On some nights I like to go to the local lounge and listen to Jazz, soul, and blues music. \r\n\r\nI love Film and am happy to share my film collection with you. I have hundreds of my favorite movies and you can watch any of them. A few of my favorites are True Romance, A Clockwork Orange, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Cool Hand Luke, Taxi Driver, and The Princess Bride. \r\n\r\nI ask that you treat my home with the same respect you would expect from me in your home. That means being respectful of my neighbors and community. Putting things back in their place for the next guest to enjoy, and caring for my property as you care for your own. In other words my home is your home. Welcome to Harlem NYC!",

       "neighborhood_overview":"The East Village (EV) is known for its cool bars and nightlife, great restaurants, and music venues. It is very hipster, artsy and unique. My block, specifically, is a living reminder of the East Village's punk-rock past. Significant moments in counterculture history happened all along the street: Abbie Hoffman invented the Yippies at No. 30 in 1967; Andy Warhol, the Velvet Underground, and Jimi Hendrix performed at now-gone experimental nightclub Electric Circus, before it closed in 1971; and gallery 51X backed eighties-era graffiti artists like Keith Haring and Basquiat. Today, the street's grasp on culture lies mostly within its diverse restaurants (frankfurters at Crif Dogs, Israeli cuisine at Hummus Place) and storefronts.

If the keys are not returned before check out, or if they are damaged, we will charge a 50.00 administrative fee through airbnb. 2. You can check in as early as 15:00. Check out is at 11:00. 3. If you need early check in or late check out, I can put you in touch with a luggage storage service that also does pick up and drop off at my apartment. They are local, they are great, and they will give you a discounted rate that I've negotiated with them. 4. Please make sure to smoke outside of our house. 5. Please make sure to ask us before bringing extra guests into our home. ABOUT PAYMENT:  Many ask about the price and extra fees and how to pay. When you put in the dates and number of people you will get our total cost. There are no taxes on top of this, but AirBnB adds their fee. It varies between 6-12% on top of our price. All the payments are safely made with credit card to AirBnB when booking. They hold the money until the day",

Also at the pier is the Intrepid Museum, an original American Navy aircraft carrier taken out of service, with all kinds of exhibits.  There is a walking and biking pathway along the Hudson River (with no cars) going from Midtown all the way to Battery Park in Lower Manhattan as well as going uptown to Riverside Drive, the boat basin, and other attractions along the river.  There are also restaurants on some of the piers and one outdoor restaurant only a few blocks from my apartment where you can watch the sunset over the Hudson River. If you like to walk and I do the",

I do not provide breakfast but I do provide complimentary wine.  Also I am extremely flexible about checking in and checking out times.   This means that you can maximize your stay by checking in as early as you like and checking out as late as you like if nobody else is checking in or out.  However I MUST know before booking your approximate check in and check out times so I can make my own plans around it and also to be sure to get you the keys and get them back when leaving.

If I'm out, you can text or call me or my co-host  24/7.  Likewise, we will give you feedback if anything seems to be misunderstood.

Even though the Annex has a full kitchen I don't allow excessive cooking.  Boiling water for tea is fine.   And there is a microwave for heating up take-out food. Why cook when I live in a neighborhood with hundreds of amazing restaurants and an excellent market 1 1/2 blocks away. Guests may come and go as they please at any time of day or night as I live in a 24 hour a day busy neighborhood. Trash cans for trash are located outside the building.  Trash cans inside the building in the front hallway are for recycling - one for mixed paper and one for plastic. Only toilet paper in the toilet.  Everything else in the waste basket.  Thank you.",

I belong in Los Angeles but for now I am east coast....\r\n\r\nThis awesome site has helped me maintain this exhausting lifestyle and so I take hosting very seriously.   Whether you stay in my New York or Miami Beach home, you will arrive to a clean and pleasant sanctuary and I assure you will discover certain zen elements common to both apartments and neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nI have met amazing people through hosting & traveling and I appreciate every  guest, those I have met in person and the others whom I hope to meet one day in life...",

       "neighborhood_overview":"The Lower East Side, sometimes abbreviated as LES, is a neighborhood in the southeastern part of the New York City borough of Manhattan, roughly located between the Bowery and the East River, and Canal Street and Houston Street. Traditionally an immigrant, working-class neighborhood, it began rapid gentrification in the mid-2000s, prompting The National Trust for Historic Preservation to place the neighborhood on their list of America's Most Endangered Places.  It's still one of the true NYC neighborhood experiences you'll ever have. See it now before it changes!!!!",

This is a traditional NYC tenement apartment so expect some character and imperfections. Fully stocked kitchen as well as grocery stores and deli's nearby. There is no washer, dryer, or dishwasher. The nearest laundromat (less than a block away) for cleaning service is Tian Tian Laundromat. You can do drop off! ‭+(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN) Allen St New York, NY  10002",

A mere two blocks from Tompkins Square Park, the street itself also has 2 gardens on it, so it's out of the concrete jungle fray.

You've got Union Square which has virtually everything. A movie theater + fine 24/7 grocery store is at the end of my block. Webster Hall is the neighboring building and of course the street is a pool hall. During the day, there is minimal traffic (it's a quiet and unusual street in that sense); at night, however, Webster Hall is a popular place. While this does not bother me, I can provide ear plugs if you are concerned. Fortunately, the bedroom is on the other side of the apartment/in the back and therefore not near the street level.",

While Lower Manhattan is the main financial center, Midtown is the country's largest commercial, entertainment, and media center; Midtown Manhattan is also a growing financial center, second in importance in the United States only to Lower Manhattan's Financial District. The majority of New York City's skyscrapers, including its tallest hotels and apartment towers, lie within Midtown. The area hosts commuters and residents working in its offices, hotels, and retail establishments; many tourists, visiting residents, and students populate the district. Some areas, such as Times Square and the Fifth Avenue corridor, have large clusters of retail stores, and Times Square is the center of Broadway theatre. The Avenue of the Americas holds the headquarters of three of the four major U.S. television networks.",

It's incredibly convenient to the 96th St. express subway station which gets you to Times Square in just 2 stops and downtown in 15 minutes.   You can reach the Natural History Museum in about a 15-minute walk and a quick subway ride to the shops at Time Warner Center/Columbus Circle.   And let's not forget the fabulous and famous markets that the Upper West Side boasts;  Fairway Market and Zabars, Barzinis and Westside Market, not to mention Trader Joes and Whole Foods - all accessible by walking or a quick subway trip.",

But just a few steps uptown and you are in the residential and uber-posh Upper East Side.  Brownstones, strollers, and fancy dog-walkers galore :)",
       "notes":"I do ask you to please keep the noise/talking to a minimum on the stairs so as not to disturb my neighbors. I also ask you to be discreet about airbnb.  As the law changes in NYC and airbnb is being debated, I do not want to attract any unnecessary attention.  I hope you understand!  I don't mention it to my neighbors, super or landlord.  If anyone asks (which is rare!), I simply say I have \"guests visiting\" :)",
       "transit":"The subway and several bus lines are super close, but you will be able to walk to many places since we are close to 59th Street & Lexington Avenue.  You might spend your whole trip without having to take the subway once.  (If you want to see Brooklyn tho- and I recommend it highly!- you will definitely want to take the subway or an Uber/Lyft.  We're not walking distance to Brooklyn ;)",
       "access":"You will have access to the entire place, all to yourselves.  The large bedroom (that fits 2 double beds), the living room, separate eat-in kitchen, and of course full bathroom. The bedroom is super quiet (faces back of building), so you can sleep well.  The living room faces 3rd Avenue, so you will definitely hear city sounds (i.e. traffic, honking, etc.), but the benefit is that it is very bright & full of sunshine.  We have an unobstructed view and see lots of sky (kinda rare in NYC ;)  There is a flat-screen TV with Netflix and Roku (Amazon Prime, etc.), but no \"regular\" TV channels. The bathroom is a standard full bath, with shampoo, conditioner, soap, handsoap, and paper supplied for you. The kitchen is a full kitchen, fully stocked with dishes, glasses, mugs, pots, pans, etc.  Also, please feel free to help yourself to any teas, coffee, cooking spices, cooking oils, etc.  I have a French press as well as a regular drip coffee maker, but no microwave.  I warm things up the old-fa",

       "house_rules":"- No shoes inside, and please be quiet in the hall and stairwell to be kind to my neighbors :) - Please use sheets on every surface/pillow you use No pets & no smoking!",

I'm away for the year earning my Masters degree at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, renting my apartment on Air BnB so it will be waiting for me when I return. I love everything to do with theatre, from Hamilton to Hamlet, hence my apartment's proximity to Broadway!\r\n\r\nPeople describe my geek-chic \"house\" as cozy and quiet in spite of its central location. I've decorated it with fine art, Harry Potter cross stitches, retro Star Wars posters, and even my little sister's paintings. The result is an eclectic and charming vibe. I'm sure families and business travelers will find it an oasis of comfort and relaxation, conveniently hidden in the heart of Chelsea. \r\n\r\nWhen you visit, be sure check out my collection of New York City guide books!  I recommend grabbing bagel at Murray's (a New York City staple located just around the corner!) and perusing the tips/sights over a cup of coffee. It's one of my favorite ways to start a spontaneous Saturday morning!",

I recently took a solo trip to southern Spain for a week, which helped me gain some clarity.  The trip pushed me to let go of some things and be truer to myself.  I decided to leave finance and return to graduate school for Social Work.  \r\n\r\nOne important thing for AirBnB roommates - it is important to me to go to sleep in a quiet room (no TV) around 11pm most nights :)",

Taxi:  An Uber to Grand Central is usually around 15-20 depending on traffic. Subway: We are 2 blocks (2 min walk) away from the 110 st station on the 6 train.  We are 15 blocks (15 min walk) away from the 96 st Station on the Q train.  There are numerous buses on Lexington and 3rd Avenue.

The LES is close via the F and M trains to everywhere uptown too.  A 20 minute ride to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue and Central Park.  Whatever you want to do, the LES is easy to get to and from. Walk across the Brooklyn, Manhattan or Williamsburg bridges for a stunning view of the city.",
       "notes":"We have a dog, Sugar, but she won't be there.  If someone is highly allergic to dog dander please be aware.  The apartment will be spotless as you see in the photos, but we do want your stay to be 100% perfect.",

Upstairs (not in the bedroom area) there is a private walk-in closet that is closed off to guests and monitored by a motion-activated video sensor - we ask that you do not enter that area. Cold brewed coffee (it's really yummy) in the fridge in a glass bottle.  Just put in a cup and throw in the microwave.  Cream and sugar will be there as well.  Printer set up on the WiFi guest access so you can print directions, maps or your plane tickets. We have a large living room floor (hardwood) that is perfect for yoga.  Mats, blocks, strap, bolster and blanket will be available.",
       "interaction":"We will meet our guests before their stay and/or also have someone available during the holidays to ensure your comfort.  If we are not available, we will have the keys at the front desk in an envelope with your name.  Keys are to be left in the apartment upon departure on the kitchen counter.",
       "house_rules":"No smoking, no pets and no loud noise that would irritate other tenants.  Sorry, but no children under 10 and no more than 2 children per stay.  Please do not enter our private closed area as the alarm is activated by motion sensor.  If any of these rules are broken, we will charge a 200 fee.",

       "host_about":"Im originally from NYC but have lived in Los Angeles for 3 years. I moved to LA to attend law school, and chose to live in Venice because of its vibrant art  culture, and laid back atmosphere which is a nice break from the hustle and bustle of LA - people seem to be friendlier and happier here, probably because they live in a beach town that is 75 degrees and sunny virtually 365 days a year.\r\n\r\nI specifically chose my apt so I could be a 1 minute walk from the beach (and the always-entertaining boardwalk) which allows me to literally walk out my door in the morning and be surfing in the pacific in literally less than 3  minutes (The NYer in me likes things to be fast). Along with the beachside location, another major reason that I chose my apt is the fact that it has a very large private back patio that is enclosed with tall bamboo; I enjoy gardening and have transformed the patio into a lush tropical garden, planting several types of Palm trees, Aloe and Blooming Aloe, Lavender, Jasmine, Tropical Ferns, countless succulents, cacti, flowers, in addition to a variety of vegetables like arugula, lettuce, squash, different types of peppers, and herbs like rosemary and basil.\r\n\r\nI am currently in my last year of law school, and although my school is downtown, I have found it easy to avoid the traffic with a little planning and using the GPS App Waze.\r\n\r\nI love traveling and backpacking, and in the past couple years I've traveled to Paris, London, Amsterdam, Argentina, Berlin, India, Thailand, Laos, Indonesia, Bermuda, Honduras, Haiti, Mexico, Argentina and Malaysia.\r\n\r\nI'd love to explore Myanmar, Africa, Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Spain\r\n\r\nSome of my other favorite activities are surfing, gardening, cooking, and going to see live music. I also enjoy making art, including painting, mixed media, electroforming metals, and really any type of creative expression.  \r\n\r\nLast but not least - I love dogs, and there is a great dog park right across the street from my apt.",

       "host_about":"I am filmmaker (writer/director/ produce) living and working in New York City since 2008. \r\nI can't live without exercise .\r\nI can't live without a bathtub. \r\nI can't live without books, and films - my apartment is full with them\r\nI can't live without a great mattress and sheets.\r\nI can't live without delivery from my fav restaurants (NYC has spoiled me)\r\n\r\nI love travel within South East Asia. Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Bali… The place I most want to visit is India.\r\n\r\nAs a filmmaker my passion for film is something I hope to share with my guests. \r\n\r\nI have a collection of over 500 DVDs in my home for your viewing pleasure, stored and alphabetized in the long white console cabinet the runs the length of the hall. There is a printed list with the names of every DVD in collection. Organized into 3 separate leather bound binders I also have a collection of documentaries, a collection of music performance DVDs, and a collection of TV shows ranging from 21 Jump Street to Ab Fab to the Sopranos.\r\n\r\nTell me about yourself and I'll leave a few recommendations of films for you!\r\n\r\nIf you noticed from the photos: books are also a passion for me, if not a bit of an addiction. I have an extensive collection of several hundred art books ranging in subject from painting, photography, jewelry, fashion, music, film, architecture, interior design. Everything is organized by subject. Aside from art books, I have hundreds of books related to my other interests organized by topic: biographies, books on film, books on philosophy, books on psychology, books on anthropology with a focus on shamanism, books on sociology, a section of fiction books ranging from Faulkner to Dostoevsky, and of course a collection of auction catalogues primarily contemporary art, magnificent jewelry, and special sales i.e. the property of Doris Duke, the property of Jackie Kennedy.\r\n\r\nThe books are ALOT OF FUN! Enjoy them but please put them back where you got them off the shelves, and also be delicate with the art books as they are expensive.\r\n\r\nMy style of traveling is often last minute, and for extended periods 3 weeks or more. I do a lot of my screenwriting while I travel. Sometimes I just get so over the city that I need a break, so I take off. \r\n\r\nMy hosting style is to be as accommodating and available as possible. I treat you as if you were a friend coming to stay. I just ask the same of guests as I ask of my friends: please be respectful of my belongings and of my privacy. Throughout the home there is expensive furniture, rugs, art, books, even the wine glasses. \r\n\r\nIt's not a museum, I live with these things in my normal life and they are meant for use. I trust my guests not to damage anything intentionally.   \r\nHey accidents happen though - if you stain a towel, tell me. If you do break a crystal wine glass from Riedel, and when you break it red wine spills on the 10,000 Tibetan rug please let me know. Certain things in the apartment like the rugs have to be cleaned in a special way and I wouldn't want you to make it worse. It's not going to be a big deal, accidents happen and we can work through it, just be honest. Rugs can be cleaned and wine glasses can be replaced. Just please let me know ahead of time and I won't be surprised and upset.\r\n\r\nIf I am traveling while you are staying in my place, I will have a local manager for the property to show you around when you arrive, and be on call to help if there is a problem. I love my home, and I want you to love it and be as comfortable there as I am.\r\n\r\nAlso since my super is useless I don't use him… Instead I found an ace local handyman named Ray, he's a great guy whose number I will leave. God forbid there is an issue, you can call him and he can sort it out.",

In my spare time I love traveling and learning about new cultures and languages. \r\n\r\nHere in Manhattan, I love Central Park close by and find myself biking, rollerblading, and simply walking a few times a week in the park. I'm a people person and enjoy meeting new people from different countries. If we meet and you speak a different language, I will probably  be asking you how to say something in your language.\r\n\r\nI look forward to meeting you and will do whatever I can to make your stay in NY enjoyable.",

I spent over a year living in Hawaii, several months in Taiwan, 6 months studying in Paris, and  I use to work for a School based out of Sweden and have spent a great deal of time there as well.  I love the world and I enjoy getting to know new parts through the people I share my home with.\r\n\r\nI head into work every morning around 9AM and come back to the Apt around 6PM each night.  I like to bike there each day if i can, and try to do a 6 mile run every night after work.  I'm active and love NYC and the waterfront.

I might have it blocked off for various reasons but if you are planning a 5 night stay and only 4 are open I can make dates available as long as no one is already booked. SUPER ACCESS: From time to time throughout the year the Super might need to get in the apartment to check on pipes or other problems that arise within the building. When checking in you agree to let Super in the apartment if it is needed during your stay. He will always call me first and not just pop in so I will let you know ahead of time to prepare (I assure you this is very infrequent maybe 1 or 2 times during the year and hope you can understand if he needs to come inside during your stay).

You won't find the restaurants and 'chains' that you find in every other city! When you walk out the front door, you'll find excitement in every direction.

And, you don't have to share a bathroom with your travel companions since each bathroom has its own shower/tub included!  They are identical bathrooms on each floor. Also, a separate door from the elevator opens into each level of the apartment which also allows privacy between you and your travel companions if you're looking for that!",

I spend much of my time traveling with my dog, a treeing walker coonhound named Bruce--whose videos can be found on you.tube by subscribing to his channel BruceAlmightyCoonhound.  Together, we spend about 20 weeks per year in NYC, and also relax in Southwest Michigan, Miami, London---or any destination that I've never been since I like traveling to new places.  I enjoy meeting new people, dining out, hanging out with friends, traveling, biking, skiing, shopping--especially at thrift stores, interior design, art, museums, college and professional sports--both the Chicago Cubs and the White Sox, theater and movies.  I LOVED the musical HAMILTON, and I have tickets to see it for the second time in August 2017!\r\n\r\nCome enjoy Chicago and stay in an eclectic area near the neighborhoods of Wicker Park, Bucktown, Logan Square, Avondale and Humboldt Park--and just one block from the Belmont El Stop on the Blue Line.\r\n\r\nMy vacation homes in Bridgman, MI are an easy drive from Chicago if you're looking for a get away--only about 1.5 hours from Chicago and just a mile off the beautiful beaches of Lake Michigan!\r\n\r\nMy apartment in NYC is perfect for a group of three or four who are looking for their own bedrooms and having two full bathrooms, as well as a kitchen and living area to gather!",

       "neighborhood_overview":"The apt is located in one of the most desirable neighborhoods in NYC. It is surrounded by Greenwich Village, TriBeca, West Village, and NoLita. You are a 15-20 minute walk away from the 9/11 memorial.  Honestly-you can walk 10 minutes in any direction and you are in a new neighborhood. Each neighborhood has it's own unique charm and things to offer. But, you don't ever need to leave SoHo. This apartment is surrounded by high-end restaurants, cozy lounges, bars, coffee shops, art galleries, and the best shopping in NYC.  You will never regret staying in SoHo!",
       "notes":"The apartment is located on the 2nd floor of the building so there are 2 flights of stairs to climb. It isn't too bad...I promise! I've never had any issue with one of my neighbors. They are all mature and very respectful. The apartment building does allow dogs so you might pass one on the stairs. Please keep this in mind if you are highly allergic to dogs.",
       "transit":"This apartment is located in an extremely safe neighborhood. It is the kind of neighborhood that the local coffee shops and restaurants know your name. You will always feel safe! One of the best things about this apartment is that it is located a block away from the C & E train. The N, R, Q, B, D, F, J, M, A, C, E, and 6 are a short walk as well.",
       "access":"You will either have the entire apartment to yourself.",
       "interaction":"I won't always be staying at the apartment. However, I'm only a short walk away. I'm always happy to help with anything you may need! Always happy to show you around the neighborhood as well.",

Even though you are in Manhattan, this neighborhood is quiet, safe, and family friendly.   Overlooking the Hudson River, you will find some really beautiful views of the George Washington Bridge, and the Palisades.   You are located near two supermarkets, a Chase Bank, a pharmacy, and multiple restaurants right outside your door.  There is also a very excellent wine shop right up the street called Vines on Pine.  A short walk south to 181st Street will take you to a Starbucks, and a wonderful Italian restaurant called Saggio.   Heading north, you will find Fort Tryon Park, and the Cloisters Museum, a must-see collection of medieval art.",

       "neighborhood_overview":"The Financial District is the PERFECT location for those wanting to visit NYC!  I specifically live down here because of the wide, less-trafficky streets so me and my dog can have long, quiet walks without having to feel claustrophobic.  There are always children outside playing out in the cobble streets directly out in front of the apartment building door, and always meeting other dogs and their dog people is truly a unique FiDi thing. Next, is its proximity to the waterfront, both East and West.  Both waterfronts have been newly renovated and you can get to either within a 10 minute walk.  Imagine going on a sun-drenched walk each morning while you're in this amazing city! Finally, the Financial District is the ULTIMATE location in Manhattan for getting around.  You can pick up almost ANY MAJOR SUBWAY LINE down here, and cabs (both yellow and luxury) run here by the truckload.  And if the weather is nice, you can pick up a CitiBike right down the street and go for a nice bike ride.",

I'm a fantastic person to ask for beauty advice, and where to shop/eat/drink/play.  I'm obsessed with Pilates, my muscular handsome Chihuahua -Tank-, nail, and hair art. I take huge, adventurous trips once/twice per year, such as driving around the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica, trekking to Macchu Piccu, trekking Mount Everest Base Camp in Nepal, visiting Bhutan, visiting my native city--Seoul, South Korea, volunteering and diving in Vietnam and Philippines, and road tripping across Nicaragua.",

       "notes":"This is the layout: On the bottom floor is the master bedroom with a California King-sized bed, closet, dressers and a flat-screen TV connected to AppleTV for streaming, a small office and the bathroom that contains a bathtub, a separate shower, and a washing machine and dryer, along with toilet and sink. Upstairs is the main entrance, along with the, for New York, very nicely-sized kitchen and a table that can expand to fit 8 for a dinner party, but normally has three seats. Also upstairs is a room which doubles as both the living room and a second bedroom. There is no door and only a half-wall to separate the living room/bedroom from the kitchen, but because it is on a separate floor from the main bedroom, there is privacy via the separation. The living room/bedroom contains a couch which, with the back cushion removed is a completely flat and comfortable single bed. There is also a single air-mattress with an electric pump stored under the couch, so you can pull this out and inflate",

There are also two Citibike kiosks within a block where you can rent a bike-share for the day.",

When I get out of the city, it is often to go on a retreat - either to lead or enjoy myself. In the summer, when I have more free time, I love going to the Met (which is so nearby and affordable that I go at least once a week) and the beach (my favorite is Cherry Grove in Fire Island!). \r\n\r\nAlthough I'm new to Airbnb, I'm really excited to share my place as a host!",

I am an annoying dog person, and I recently learned that I am terrified of fish (snorkeling can be incredibly fun, and simultaneously horrifying). My sense of humor is 50% dark and 50% unintelligible and ridiculous voices. Also, I like scotch, rocks, with a soda back.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't guessed by now, I am a sterotypical ADHD child of my generation.",

With worldly cuisine, live music lounges, comedy clubs, bars and nightlife activities, independent theaters, parks and dog runs, easy transportation and the hudson river, you are truly left without a dull moment. Bodegas surround you but Morton Williams is your best bet for quick groceries. There's a laundry mat on Thompson street and city bikes on Carmine. One block up is the West 4th station where the A, C, E, B, D, F, and M lines will transport you to virtually every inch of New York City. Being in Greenwich, you've got the West Village, Union Square, Soho and the East Village on each side of you. MacDougal Street makes for a balanced lifestyle because it's peaceful in the mornings and lively at night. I like to think of NYC as the epicenter of the USA, and Greenwich as the epicenter of NYC.

There is a parking garage in the building but the rates are typical NYC expensive. I park on the street and have for years, and you can generally find a spot within a 5 minute walk on most days, especially the weekends. Please be sure to read all street signs to see when you can park on what days. It's pretty simple but you have to read the signs. There are many bus stops nearby too but I don't generally take the bus. There is a Citibike (shared bike) station on the north side of 95th Street just north of our building. This can be great if you want to rent a bike. (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Citibike to learn more.",

Lots of restaurants and galleries near by (please check out our guidebook-a few stops on the subway will take you to the hot spots). Please have a slice of authentic New York pizza during your stay from the pizzeria on Broadway, it's great and cheap! An adorable new bar on Evergreen and Moffat and a new coffee shop with sweets and breakfast on Wilson and Moffat- it's called Routine.",
       "notes":"Great up and coming neighborhood, the block is full of young professionals, students and artists.  This is in a great location to explore many parts of Brooklyn and access Manhattan.  The Lower East Side of Manhattan is about a 20 minute ride (Essex Street stop) on the train a block from the house (J/Z line).  The L train is a 5 block walk - it takes you through parts of Bushwick (Morgan/Jefferson stops) and into the heart of Williamsburg (Bedford) in 15 minutes - or to 1st Avenue/Union Square in 25 minutes.  There are many connections to get anywhere.",
       "transit":"We are a half block walk from the Chauncey (J/Z) station, and a 5 minute walk from either the Wilson (L) station, or the Bushwick/Aberdeen (L) station. Both trains offer fast access to the city in 25-30 minutes and make excellent connections with other train lines.  You can get to the Lower East Side in about 20 minutes or Union Square in 25 minutes. Quick cab ride from LGA and JFK, about 30 minutes depending on time of day. Or grab the AirTran to the J train by public transportation, it leaves you a half a block from the apartment.  Uber is a great application you can download should you prefer a cab.",

Bed room facing the court yard so peace and quiet at night even in the middle of bustling Manhattan! Guests have access to all amenities and I will meet and greet you upon arrival! I will also assist with anything you might want to know about the Big Apple and help make sure your stay exceeds your expectations!",
